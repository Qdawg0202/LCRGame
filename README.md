# lcrGame

Based on the ABSOLUTELY CLASSIC dice game where no players actively do anything and the will of the game is determined entirely through RNG (JUST LIKE LIFE) 

SELECT THE AMOUNT OF PLAYERS

PLAYER NAMES ARE NUMBERED (LIKE PRISONERS, WHICH ALSO MIRRORS REALITY)
PRESSING ENTER ROLLS THE DICE FOR THE WHOLE GAME
THE WINNER IS ALREADY PREDETERMINED (BY FATE) AND THERE IS NOTHING TO CHANGE THAT (AGAIN, JUST LIKE REAL LIFE!!)



I AM THE REAL LIFE
